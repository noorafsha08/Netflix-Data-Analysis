# 📺 Netflix Data Analysis

This project analyses the Netflix dataset to extract meaningful insights about its content library using **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

In this analysis, I:

✅ Explored the Netflix dataset from Kaggle  
✅ Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis  
✅ Answered key questions:
- How many movies vs TV shows are on Netflix?
- What are the top 10 most common genres?
- How has content addition changed year-wise?
- Which countries contribute the most content to Netflix?

✅ Visualised data insights with clear, aesthetic plots
